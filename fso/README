This code is a C++ implementation fo Flock of Starling Optimization Algorithm.

To compile

1) make all

2) ./fso_exec

3) the results are stored in the txt files.

4) global_best.txt stores the global best for each iteration, in the gbp.txt you can
   find also the coordinates of the GB

5) in the postition.txt file, you find the coordinates of the whole group in the form
   X1, Y1, X2, Y2,........Xn,Yn

6) in the velocity file has been stored the velocities of all individuals it has the 
   same codification of the position files.
7) make clean will remove the executable file and the log files.
   NB the files are created in append mode, so if you run multiple test without doing 
   make clean you are appending to the same file the result of each test!
8) For disable the log file creation comment #define DEBUG on fso.h file

These files are useful to choose the right parameters for the algorithm. 
You can graph the trajectories starting from them.
